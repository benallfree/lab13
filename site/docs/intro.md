# 2025 Challenge: JS13K Online

We're thrilled to announce that JS13k's newest partner, Cloudflare, is sponsoring the **JS13K Online** category for this year's JS13K competition!

The JS13K Online category challenges developers to create MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) versions of their games. This experimental category is powered by a JS13K-hosted version of [PartyServer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/partyserver), Cloudflare's PartyKit-inspired scalable server based on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).
